SETTLERS OF CATAN
Submission: Sherman Leung, Sierra Kaplan-Nelson, Nick Troccoli
---------------------------
We wrote a couple different agents for this assignment (all against the baseline Random agent).
These agents are: Expectimax, Expectiminimax, and Monte Carlo.

By default, if you just run:

python settlers.py

It will run the non-graphics, Expectimax vs. Random simulation.  To run Expectiminimax vs.
Random, please go into gameConstants.py and change the first number in DEFAULT_PLAYER_ARRAY from 11 to 12.
(11 is Expectimax, 12 is Expectiminimax).

To run the Monte Carlo agent vs. Random, run

python settlers.py -r -c

To change the number of simulations, add use the -n flag to specify the number you want.

To view the graphics associated with the game, add the -g flag.
